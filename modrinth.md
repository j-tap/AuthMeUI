## What Does It Do?

When players join your server, instead of seeing "Please login with /login <password>" in chat, they get a nice popup window where they can type their password directly. Same goes for registration - a clean dialog with password fields, not messy chat commands.

It's like upgrading from a flip phone to a smartphone, but for your server's login system.

## The Experience

### For Returning Players

They see a welcoming dialog asking for their password. Type it in, click login, done. No commands to remember, no typos in chat for everyone to see.

### For New Players  

A registration dialog pops up with two password fields (password + confirm). They fill it out, click register, and they're good to go. You can even make them accept your server rules first!

### Server Rules

Want players to read and accept rules before playing? AuthMeUI can show them a rules dialog they have to accept. No more "I didn't know that was against the rules" excuses.
