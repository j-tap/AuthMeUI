## Overview

AuthMeUI replaces the traditional chat-based login and registration prompts with beautiful, native Minecraft dialogs. Players see clean popup windows for entering passwords, registering accounts, and accepting server rules - no more spamming commands in chat!

## Features

- **Native Dialog Windows** - Uses Minecraft's built-in dialog system for a seamless experience
- **Login Dialog** - Clean password entry with customizable buttons
- **Registration Dialog** - Password + confirmation fields with validation
- **Rules Dialog** - Display server rules players must accept before playing
- **Configuration Phase Support** - Show authentication dialogs BEFORE players join the server (blocking authentication)
- **Fully Customizable** - Every message, button, and title can be configured
- **Multilingual Support** - Per-player language selection with automatic locale detection
- **PlaceholderAPI Support** - Use any placeholder in your dialog text
- **MiniMessage Formatting** - Full support for colors, gradients, and formatting
- **Universal AuthMe Support** - Works with all AuthMe forks out of the box
- **bStats Integration** - Anonymous usage statistics

## Authentication Modes

AuthMeUI supports two authentication modes:

### Post-Join Mode (Default)

The traditional approach where dialogs appear after the player has joined the server. Players are in-game but restricted until authenticated.

### Configuration Phase Mode (Pre-Join)

A modern approach using Minecraft's configuration phase to show authentication dialogs **before** the player joins the server. Players cannot enter the world until they authenticate successfully.

To enable configuration phase mode, set in your `config.yml`:

```yaml
dialogs:
  use-configuration-phase: true
  configuration-phase-timeout: 60  # seconds before disconnecting unauthenticated players
```

## Supported AuthMe Versions

## Configuration

### Localization

AuthMeUI supports per-player localization. By default, it auto-detects the language from the Minecraft client locale and falls back to `en`.

1. Set default language in `plugins/AuthMeUI/config.yml`:

```yaml
localization:
  default-language: "en"
  auto-detect-player-locale: true
  prune-legacy-config: false
```

2. Add translation files in `plugins/AuthMeUI/translations/` (e.g. `ru.yml`, `de.yml`).
3. Reload plugin with `/authmeui reload`.
4. If you upgraded from an older version, old text keys from `config.yml` are migrated into `translations/en.yml` automatically.
   Set `localization.prune-legacy-config: true` once to remove migrated text keys from config (a backup file is created first).

```yaml
# Dialog Settings
dialog:
  can-close-with-escape: false  # Prevent closing dialogs with ESC
  button-columns: 2             # Number of button columns
  input-width: 200              # Width of text input fields

# Login Dialog
login-dialog:
  title: "<gold>Welcome Back!"
  body:
    - "<gray>Please enter your password to continue."
  submit-button: "<green>Login"
  password-label: "Password"

# And much more...
```

See the full [config.yml](https://github.com/TejasLamba2006/AuthMeUI/blob/main/src/main/resources/config.yml) for all options.
